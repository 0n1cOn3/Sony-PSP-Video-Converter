480psp is a python script that generates ffmpeg commands that generate PSP-Playable mp4 files. I tested this with my PSP-3000, so I don't know
if any other psp models will work.

Audio default bitrate is 128kbps. I didn't include video bitrate because ffmpeg causes bloat when you manually set it.

This is very incomplete and I can't regularly maintain it, but I hope other people can be able to use it.
