THE ROOTBEER-WARE LICENSE (Revision 42):
<phk@FreeBSD.ORG> wrote this file. MaxSolar0713 forked it. 0n1cOn3 refactored and cleaned up the code base. As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff.
If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a rootbeer or other soda in return.
