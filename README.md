480psp is a python script that generates ffmpeg commands that generate PSP-Playable mp4 files. I tested this with my PSP-3000, so I don't know
if any other psp models will work.

Included is the standard generator with bitrate defaults at 128kA and 1000kV, and also a generator without the Video bitrate control so you can let FFMPEG decide
what to do with it.

This is very incomplete and I can't regularly maintain it, but I hope other people can be able to use it.
